  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Project Description
  
  The goal of this project was to further my understanding of Express.js and build a backend framework to support the functionality of an already developed front end application. In building the backend the user can now write new notes, view past notes, and delete notes that are no longer needed. I learned how to structure routes, use express,  and set up a server.
